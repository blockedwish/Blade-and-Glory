Greetings, respected professors, fellow students, and all those gathered here. I'm delighted to present my academic project—a 3D video game developed using Unity and programmed in C#. This project marks the culmination of my academic journey at UNIVERSITY OF CATANIA, reflecting the culmination of the skills and knowledge I've gained during my studies. It's worth noting that, while I've been responsible for the development and programming, the 3D models used in the game were sourced online, emphasizing the collaborative nature of this academic endeavor.

## Roadmap
Game Development Technologies:
This project delves into the fascinating world of video game development, incorporating a wide range of technologies and features. It's important to emphasize that while I've undertaken the game's development and programming, the 3D models used in the game were sourced online, underlining the collaborative nature of this academic endeavor.

- 3D Animations:
One of the standout features of this game is the utilization of 3D animations. These animations bring the virtual world to life, enhancing the gaming experience and making it visually captivating.

- Raycast:
The implementation of raycasting adds depth to the game, allowing for dynamic interactions with the game environment. This technology is fundamental in creating realistic and interactive gameplay.

- User Interface:
The game boasts a sophisticated user interface that enhances the player's experience, providing crucial information and enabling easy navigation throughout the gaming world.

- In-Game Shop for Power-Ups:
We've included an in-game shop where players can purchase power-ups to enhance their gameplay. This feature adds an element of strategy and customization, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.

- Particle Systems:
The game utilizes particle systems to create stunning visual effects, such as fire, explosions, and more. These systems contribute to the immersive and dynamic nature of the game world.

- Sound Design:
Sound plays a vital role in the gaming experience. We've incorporated a variety of sound effects and a captivating soundtrack to engage players and enhance the overall immersion.

- Intelligent AI Enemies:
Our game features intelligent AI-controlled enemies that respond dynamically to player actions. This creates a challenging and engaging gameplay experience, keeping players on their toes.

- Coroutines:
Coroutines are used to manage asynchronous tasks in the game, enabling smooth transitions and events that occur outside of the game's main flow.

- NavMesh for Navigation:
NavMesh technology has been integrated to control navigation within the game world. It provides a seamless and efficient pathfinding system for both the player and AI-controlled entities.

- Environmental Interaction:
The game emphasizes interaction with the surrounding environment, allowing players to influence and manipulate the game world, adding depth and variety to the gaming experience.



Conclusion:
In conclusion, this academic project is a testament to the multidisciplinary nature of game development. It's a combination of artistic creativity and technical expertise, and while the 3D models used were not created by me, their integration into the game exemplifies the collaborative nature of modern game development.

I'm immensely proud of the effort and dedication that went into creating this 3D video game. It serves as a representation of the knowledge and skills I've gained during my academic journey. I'm looking forward to sharing this project with you, and I'm open to any questions or discussions that may arise. Thank you for your attention.
